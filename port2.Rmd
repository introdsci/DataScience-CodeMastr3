### 2. Model Planning and Building

Some predictions I would like to make from my model are how certain groups of people answered on the survey or where they stand politically or economically. In the previous rmd I attempted to show how you could set a number of parameters like sex and how they answered a certain question to see how many people fit those criteria. You could then take the percentage total of all or of that specific sex or whatever criteria you specified.

These predictions could matter because it can show biases within certain groups and potentially how to fix those biases. If a group of uneducated people have a certain bias to things you could say that with education people are less likely to vote or answer questions that certain way.

### 3. Results and Operationalization
