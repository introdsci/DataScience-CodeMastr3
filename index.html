<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>While this project has been frought with hardship of uncreativity and difficulties finding datasets I hope this suffices.</p>
<p>This portfolio showcases possibilities of multiple cases. I wasn't looking for anything in particular to show. I'm mainly showing you how you could go about finding what you would want to know.</p>
<div>
<h3>1. Discovery and Data Preparation</h3>
<p>My motivation for this topic is I&rsquo;m interested if there is a link between education, economic standing, and political standing.</p>
<p>This is the link to part 1.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>2. Model Planning and Building</h3>
<p>Some examples of things I would like to model are if/how 2 factors effect the other.</p>
<p>One example of this is I would like to see if the amount of education you've received and your economic standing affect your political leaning. Could also be if your political leaning and economic standing affect your education level.</p>
<p>This is the link to part 2.</p>

<h3>3. Results and Operationalization</h3>
<p>After gathering information about if things affect one another we could think about how to use this information.</p>
<p>A way to use this information would be, for example, to educate people more or focus more time in school on certain subjects to make sure they are educated about that subject.</p>
